# Dictionaries and Sets both are Data collections in Python

## Dict?
### Sets?

# Dict are anotherr way to manage data but can be a little more Dynamic
# Dict work as a KEY AND VALUE
# KEY = THE REFERENCE OF THE OBJECT
# VALUE = WHAT THE DATA STORAGE MECHANISM YOU WISH TO USE
# Dynamic as it we have Lists, and another dict inside a dict
# Syntax -  name = {} we use {} brackets to declare a Dict
#             key = value

students_1 = {
    "name": "James",
    "stream": "DevOps",
    "completed_lessons": 4,
    "completed_lessons_names": ["data types", "git and github", "operators", "Lists and Tuples"]
                            #          0             1              2                3
}
# Let's check if we have got the syntax right and print the dict
# print(students_1)
# print(type(students_1))
#print(students_1["stream"]) # This is how we can fetch the value saved in the key called stream in our dict
#print(students_1["completed_lessons_names"][1])
# Could we apply CRUD on a Dict
# print the second last index of key completed_essions_names:[]
#print(students_1["completed_lessons_names"][-2])

# How can we change the value of any key in our dict
students_1["completed_lessons"] = 3
#print(students_1["completed_lessons"])

#Let's see how can we remove an item from our completed lessons names
students_1["completed_lessons_names"].remove("operators")
#print(students_1["completed_lessons_names"])

# We have some builtin methods that we can use with dict
#print(students_1.keys())

# To print all the values only values()
#print(students_1.values())

# Set are also Data collection
# Syntax name = {"", "", ""}
# What is the difference between sets are dict
# Sets are unordered
shopping_list = ["eggs", "tea", "milk"]
              #     0       1      2
print(shopping_list)
car_part = {"Engine", "Wheels", "Windows"}
print(car_part)
# add an item to Set
car_part.add("seats")
# can we remove an item
car_part.discard("Wheels")
print(car_part)
